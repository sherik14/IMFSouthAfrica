        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has played a key role in shaping South Africa’s economy by providing financial assistance and policy support. Over the years, it has helped stabilize the economy, fund critical infrastructure, and manage financial crises.

            Notably, the $4.3 billion COVID-19 Relief Loan (2020) helped sustain essential services during the pandemic, while the $2.5 billion Eskom Bailout (2019-Present) aimed to rescue the struggling energy sector. While these funds provided relief, they also came with conditions that influenced national policies, sparking debates on economic independence and long-term growth.
            
            This website explores the benefits and challenges of IMF funding in South Africa, analyzing its impact on key sectors and the nation’s financial future.
